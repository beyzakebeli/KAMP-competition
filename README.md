# KAMP Competition  

This repository contains the source code and final report of **Team FEB42** (Beyza Nur Kebeli and Eda Atalay) for the **"제4회 K-인공지능 제조데이터 분석 경진대회" (4th K-Artificial Intelligence Manufacturing Data Analysis Competition).**

### 🏆 Competition Task  
The competition focused on **improving productivity and enhancing the working environment in root industries (casting) companies** through artificial intelligence algorithms. Participants were required to:  
- Identify key challenges in **die casting** processes.  
- Conduct **data analysis and preprocessing** for informed decision-making.  
- Develop and compare different **machine learning/deep learning models** to optimize casting operations.  

### 📄 Report Contents  
The final report provides detailed insights into:  
- **Die casting processes** and their critical challenges.  
- **Comprehensive data analysis** and preprocessing pipeline.  
- **Development and evaluation** of various models:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)  
  - Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN)  
- **Performance comparison** of these models.  

### 📂 Dataset  
The dataset used for this competition is available on the [**KAMP** website](https://www.kamp-ai.kr/main) under the name:  
📌 **"주조 공정최적화 제조AI데이터셋"**  

### Note:
- 🔜 **English version of the report** will be made available.
